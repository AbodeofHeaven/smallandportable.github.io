<h1>A declaration of war!</h1>
<br>
<p> The Governor has released in a statement today that he will
staunchly defend all negatve and destructive influences in our
region. A vandalism attack has targeted many wiki pages relating to the
nation of Iustus, and Iustus has called out to the micronational 
community to aid them.</p>
<br>
<p> Governor Nisu has called this attack "heartbreaking" and 
"I hope to see more nations rally to Iustus' side". </p>
<br>
<p>It turns out that the nation behind these was Magnolia.</p>
<p>The 43rd hopes to not only aid other nations in the
<p>Greater Toronto Area, but also to assert themselves in the
World Stage. A declaration was released on the fifth, to "Aid
our brothers in Pickering... We may differ on political ideals,
but we must do something about this [provocation].</p>
<br>
<p> Governor Nisu hopes that Iustus will recognize us as an ally, 
Just as we have opened our support to them during this critical time.</p>
