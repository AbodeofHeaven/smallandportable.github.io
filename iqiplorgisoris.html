<h3>THE PARTICLE THEORY OF MATTER</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. All matter is made of particles</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>2. All particles of one substance are the same (ie the same element)</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>3. Different substances are made of different particles (ie different elements)</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>4. Particles are in constant motion, except those at absolute zero (0 K, -273 C)</p>
<p>   The more energy each particle contains, the faster it moves.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>5. There are attractive forces between particles (forces are stronger when particles are closer together).</p>
