<h1> MY YOGA RESPONSE </h1>
<p>This website will be temporary</p>
<br>
<p> I think I did quite well in yoga class, but it was a bit loud. Not from other people talking, but everyone was</p>
<p>Moving so much that I felt it was hard to concentrate. I feel that otherwise I did well.</p>
<p> I felt more tired at the end of class, probably because i've been moving out and about all day, and It felt a bit tiresome</p>
<p> In contrast.</p>
