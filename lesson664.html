<h1><i>&#664;</i></h1>
<br>
<p>This strange sound is only used in a few natural languages. Due to there being</p>
<p>only two (or three) vowels in ogo, we had to include strange sounds.</p>
<p>This one is prounced by creating a pocket of air with your tounge on the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>Then Releasing the air by "kissing" your lips. Usually, you can just get away by blowing</p>
<p>a kiss.</p>
<br>
<p>It is important not to pause mid-word just to pronounce this.</p>
<p>If you want to hear its pronounciation you can go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clic_bilabial_sourd.ogg">Here</a></p>
<p>Try adding the sound mid senstence, so it will sound like any other sound.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to do this, any Xhosa lesson will teach you how to do it,</p>
<p>Just replace the other clicks with the &#664;.</p>
