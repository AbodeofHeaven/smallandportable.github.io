<h1>What's in a banana?</h1>
<i><h3>What's in a banana?</h3>></i>
<br>
<br>
<p>A basic explanation: Banana is a fruit made of water and sugar.</p>
<br>
<p>A more <b>scientific</b> explanation: Bananas are made of 75% water and 12% natural sugars,</p>
<p>Including Fructose(40% of 12%), Sucrose(2% of 12%) and Maltose(0.5% of 12%). Bananas also contain 5% starch and 3%.</p>
<p>Cellulose.</p>
<p><h4>What about the amino acids?</h4></p>
<p>Although the amino acids make up less than 1 percent of the banana, around 11% of that is Histidine, 16% is Aspartic acid,</p>
<p>And 19% is Glutamic, With Leucine, Lysine, Phenylalanine, Arginine, Valine, Alanine, Serine</p>
<p>Glycine, Threonine, Isoleucine, Proline, Tryptophan, Cystine, Tyrosine and Methionine</p>
<p>Making up 7,5,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,1,1,1 and less than 1 respectivley.
<br>
<p><h4>And the fatty acids?</h4></p>
<p>Fatty acids make up around 1% of a banana, and of that 1 percent, Palmitic acid has 30 percent,</p>
<p>While Omega-6 makes up 14%, Omega-3 sits at 22%. The other 33% is made up of Phytosterols, Potassium sulfate</p>
<p>Oxalic acid, and other very minor compounds.</p>
<p><h4>What about the colour?</h4></p>
<p>The colour comes from an immesurably small amount of complex natural colouring agents</p>
<p>And Proteins.</p>
<br>
<h3>THE PARTICLE THEORY OF MATTER</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. All matter is made of particles</p>
<center><p>Water is comprised of many,many moleculars. So small, you can't even see them witha microscope.</p>
<p>2. All particles of one substance are the same (ie the same element)</p>
<center><p>All water moleculars are comprised of the same class of atoms(H2O)</p>
<p>3. Different substances are made of different particles (ie different elements)</p>
<center><p>My water may be made of H2O, but my Orange juice is made of C6H12O6 (sugar) and C6H8O6. (tangy taste)</p>
<p>4. Particles are in constant motion, except those at absolute zero (0 K, -273 C)</p>
<center><p>My water's moleculars were moving very fast, So I put them in the freezer and It slowed them down.</p>
<center><p>Just like you need food to get energy, Moleculars need heat to get energy. energy cannot be created</p>
<center><p>out of the blue (Just like matter) so the heat needs to get it's energy that it is transferring</p>
<center><p>To my water at room temperature from somewhere else. In your house here in Canada, It's</p>
<center><p>Most likely coming from the sun(In summer) or the heating system (in winter)</p>
<center><p>Which in turn get it from other energy sources.</p>
<p>   The more energy each particle contains, the faster it moves.</p>
<center><p>Again, This is like the last one. Moleculars love to move and vibrate, and they will use up</p>
<center><p>The heat energy as fast as they can by burning it as fast as possible. A good way to do this</p>
<center><p>Is to move around faster.</p>
<p>5. There are attractive forces between particles (forces are stronger when particles are closer together).</p>
<center><p> Why is my water not just made up of "water particles" And instead H2O? Because Water is not an element,</p>
<center><p> And instead the atoms that make up my Moleculars Bond together to make my water.</p>
