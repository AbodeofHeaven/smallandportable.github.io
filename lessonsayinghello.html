<h1><i>Saying Hello</i></h1>
<br>
<h3>Hello</h3>
<p>Saying hello is very simple. There are varying degrees of formality.</p>
<p>If you wnat to say hello to someone you know, say xoxu.</p>
<p>This also works for goodbye. If you want to be more formal, say xoxu&#x30c;&#660;o.</p>
<p>This actually means "O you! I greet you.". </p>
<p>You may wonder what the &#660; is. This is a "glottal stop", a</p>
<p>Sound that you probably have used before. It is the sound of the hyphen in "uh-oh."</p>
<br>
<h3>Please and thank you</h3>
<p>There are typically no words for "please" or "thank you",</p>
<p>Although you may use the word "uxoxunggo" to say "please".</p>
<p>We will not use this in daily life, however, as it means "I implore you".</p>
